# Construction_Site_Analysis


Responsible for the development of Front-End tool using Tkinter python.
Analysed multiple algorithms such as SVM,KNN,Naive Bytes,Logistic Regression for the predicaction of accidents.
Comparison of OSHA dataset to the algorithm is integrated using NLP and Text Mining to produce efficient accuracy.
The final predication is classfied using Bar Charts and Graphs.
Tool and Technologies such as Tkinter,Python, Scikit,Numpy,Pandas, Matplotlib are used for coding and development
